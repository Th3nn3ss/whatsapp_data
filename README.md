# whatsapp_data
This is an except on my journey into data science.
I obtained this data from the IMSU C++ Competition whatsapp group organised by Mrs Olebara as a way for students to communicate
easily about their problems in writing and competing in the legendary language created by Dennis Richie and Bjarne Straustrup.

By my first commit I had been able to collect the data and using python, I had strip out some of the white spaces.
