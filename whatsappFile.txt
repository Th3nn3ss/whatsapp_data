06/12/2019, 19:35 - Dennis mcDennis: To accept input is cin
06/12/2019, 19:35 - Chibundu Com. Sci: How do you mean?
06/12/2019, 19:37 - Dennis mcDennis: After using cout << "Enter your name:" ;
06/12/2019, 19:38 - Dennis mcDennis: You then use cin to accept the input. E.g...
06/12/2019, 19:38 - Dennis mcDennis: cin >> name ;
06/12/2019, 19:39 - Dennis mcDennis: But you must have already declared a variable named name as a string.
06/12/2019, 19:40 - Chibundu Com. Sci: That is: you mean this👇

cout << "Enter your name:" ;

cin >> name ;
06/12/2019, 19:40 - Chibundu Com. Sci: Yea

06/12/2019, 20:04 - Chibundu Com. Sci: Welcome to everyone, who was added to this group or came in through the invite link.

This group as mandated by our Lecture and mother Dr Mrs Comfort Olebara Ph.d is a means through which we develop ourselves in C++ programming.
 
With this in mind, let's bring up matter that relates to C++ programming language and other related languages. 
So that las las, after school we no go carry last. We will have something tangible we would lay hands on as a skill for both income making and impacting of younger lives.

Great Computer Scientist....

God help us all

22/12/2019, 21:49 - Dennis mcDennis: i think Mrs. Olebara is doing better things with her time as should we...
22/12/2019, 21:50 - Dennis mcDennis: ...she deserves a rest guys. Let's give her a break.
22/12/2019, 21:51 - Henry Panadol: I think, so let's discuss about the last phase, what possible error did anyone notice?
22/12/2019, 21:52 - Dennis mcDennis: I noticed that I am the only one to comment on all the questions she posted.
22/12/2019, 21:52 - Chibundu Com. Sci: Pls let someone help explain that constructors and destructors, I know understand am like that
22/12/2019, 21:53 - Dennis mcDennis: anyone care to explain why?
22/12/2019, 21:53 - Henry Panadol: Yes! Follow by Nandi and pius
22/12/2019, 21:53 - Dennis mcDennis: Pius no join.
22/12/2019, 21:54 - Henry Panadol: Go back to the blog, Pius and nnadi have equal number of questions answered
22/12/2019, 21:56 - Dennis mcDennis: No I mean pius was just copy pasting your code ... him no join for people wey them dey count.
22/12/2019, 21:57 - Henry Panadol: Chapter 4 of c++, will put you through what constructor, destructor and code snippets is all about
22/12/2019, 21:57 - Burette Chinweotito Okereke: *Good thing I did not participate in the first phase, it would have been unfair to you guys.*
22/12/2019, 21:57 - Chibundu Com. Sci: Maybe becos of data and service, for me I did not attempt the last question
22/12/2019, 21:57 - Chibundu Com. Sci: I did not know that a question was posted yesterday, I did not do that one
22/12/2019, 21:57 - Burette Chinweotito Okereke: *That is for Dr Olebara to decide,, not you*
22/12/2019, 21:58 - Olebara Maxim Com. Sci: How?
22/12/2019, 21:58 - Ifechukwu Com. Sci: Burette remember our bet.
22/12/2019, 21:58 - Dennis mcDennis: is your copy pasting ability that legendary?
22/12/2019, 21:58 - Henry Panadol: Never loose courage, you can still make this time around
22/12/2019, 21:58 - Chibundu Com. Sci: As in ehh
22/12/2019, 21:59 - Chibundu Com. Sci: 🤣
22/12/2019, 22:00 - Burette Chinweotito Okereke: *Yes I remember*
*I patiently await the 2nd phase*
*It will be a one man show*
22/12/2019, 22:00 - Olebara Maxim Com. Sci: Dennis reply me😔
22/12/2019, 22:00 - Ifechukwu Com. Sci: 😂😂😂...
22/12/2019, 22:01 - Dennis mcDennis: constructors are used to initialize new objects of a particular class and the destructor does the opposite, to destroy the object after it has been used.
22/12/2019, 22:02 - Burette Chinweotito Okereke: *First rule of any competition, Never underestimate your rival*
22/12/2019, 22:03 - Dennis mcDennis: she posted about 6 questions. How many did you answer?
22/12/2019, 22:04 - Dennis mcDennis: You are to rival to the might of Henry Ozemena.

23/12/2019, 07:17 - Burette Chinweotito Okereke: *you mean to say that the cash I will take home today has been increased to 10k?,, incredible !*
23/12/2019, 07:17 - Burette Chinweotito Okereke: <Media omitted>
23/12/2019, 07:18 - Chibundu Com. Sci: Copy and paste is not allowed
23/12/2019, 07:20 - +234 9015839997: For what
23/12/2019, 07:22 - Dr. Mrs Olebara Comfort: After this phase, the project topic will be given. Use C++ to create a Full stack(Design to Database) Application.
23/12/2019, 07:30 - Chibundu Com. Sci: Today's competition has rules
1. You must has a profile to.participate
2. You should not copy and paste someone's codes...same variables etc
3. You must attempt all questions
23/12/2019, 08:35 - Dennis mcDennis: 😱.... Are we really talking about a web App?
23/12/2019, 08:35 - +234 807 902 3468 left
23/12/2019, 08:37 - Chibundu Com. Sci: Maybe my brother
23/12/2019, 08:45 - Henry Panadol: Hint:-. Full stack means DESIGNING the front end, using codes and template, and backed using database

Just think of anyone you can perfectly do and defend.
23/12/2019, 08:46 - Chibundu Com. Sci: Is it possible to do the back end, using C++?
23/12/2019, 08:50 - Henry Panadol: PHP will go a long way to do the back end and MYSQLI and  PHP MYADMIN can help you do the database
23/12/2019, 08:51 - Henry Panadol: You can also use JavaScript for the back end
23/12/2019, 08:52 - Chibundu Com. Sci: Is it possible to use C++ for backend?
23/12/2019, 08:54 - Henry Panadol: Bro, back end is for security, using c++ for back end, simply means that hackers can easily penetrate into your database and collect information.
23/12/2019, 09:43 - Dennis mcDennis: Chibundu, I understand your question and it's the reason for my exclamation 😱... Because the competition is on c++ and although it's possible to do both front-end and back-end with c++, it is very tedious and complex that it is not usually used.
23/12/2019, 09:48 - Dennis mcDennis: She has to give us some kind of clarification, which am sure she will.
23/12/2019, 10:05 - Chibundu Com. Sci: 👍
23/12/2019, 11:32 - Henry Panadol: This message was deleted
23/12/2019, 11:34 - Henry Panadol: Bro do you mean she should build the house while you do the painting?

She said "full stack, which means you should code both in front end and back end and make it accessible via the internet.
23/12/2019, 11:48 - Dennis mcDennis: So Mr Uncle, which framework or library are you using for this?
23/12/2019, 11:49 - Dennis mcDennis: What makes a language easy to code for the web is the available libraries and frameworks you can import to it to make things easier which is what we call abstraction and inheritance.
23/12/2019, 11:50 - Dennis mcDennis: So do you have any insight that we don't know about please share.
23/12/2019, 11:50 - Henry Panadol: For the front end, I am using framework + coding

For the back end I am using the tools:-. MYSQLI, PHP MY ADMIN,
23/12/2019, 11:54 - Dennis mcDennis: Enjoy... We will join you. After we've been given permission to eat from Uncle's plate.
23/12/2019, 11:55 - Henry Panadol: Although it is a very big project, if you have knowledge of JavaScript, you can do the back end, while you use PHP or MYSQLI to create the database, and c++ and framework for the front end
23/12/2019, 11:58 - Dennis mcDennis: 👨🏻‍💻
23/12/2019, 12:21 - Dennis mcDennis: We don't know Javascript or Mysql or php... So what does this mean for us? Are we disqualified or unqualified?
23/12/2019, 12:24 - Dennis mcDennis: Uncle has already won this money, why should Pius and I even bother 😟...

23/12/2019, 23:06 - Olebara Maxim Com. Sci: Please.. I don't really understand the question.

 Is it a kind of g.p calculation?
23/12/2019, 23:08 - Olebara Maxim Com. Sci: Someone should answer me naaa
23/12/2019, 23:17 - Henry Panadol: Are you noticing something! I don't see other people post, even my own post I can see it, all I see is my profile picture

24/12/2019, 06:43 - Dennis mcDennis: Morning Ma.
24/12/2019, 06:48 - Dennis mcDennis: As a personal note.. Programming is awesome and fun. The c++ language is great but not very feasible for the realization of the flexibility of our imagination. There are so much we still need to learn before we can really do some great works on the language.
24/12/2019, 06:51 - Dennis mcDennis: But then ....We love a good challenge. Thanks for the opportunity.

25/12/2019, 15:27 - Henry Panadol: Good program! If you are using Dev-c++, you have to declare:. Using std:: cout;

Again! You have to end the first and second cout statement, which is in a string with:. "/n"; or endl so that the output will be in different lines

You can also concatenate it .
25/12/2019, 15:51 - Dennis mcDennis: 🙄
25/12/2019, 15:54 - Dennis mcDennis: If you are "using std::cout;" then what's the purpose of "using namespace std;"?
